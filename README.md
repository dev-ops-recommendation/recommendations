# DevOps Squad Project - Team Recommendations

## Description
Each Squad should have RESTful microservice that they will develop based on a resource from an eCommerce application.This is a repo for recommendations resource.

## Recommendations
The `recommendations resource` is a representation a product recommendation based on another product. 
* It's essentially a relationship between two products that "go together" (e.g., radio and batteries, printers and ink, shirts and pants, etc.). 
* It could also recommend based on what other customers have purchased like "customers who bought item A usually buy item B". 
* Recommendations should have a recommendation type like cross-sell, upsell, accessory, etc. This way a product page could request all of the up-sells for a product.
